This file contains the list of changes whih were made in FreeHEP VectorGraphics 
in May 2012 by Alexander Levantovsky for MagicPlot scientific plotting application.
Magicplot Systems, LLC, Saint Petersburg, Russia, http://magicplot.com
Special thanks to Mikhail Petrov (SPbSU) for testing EPS and PDF syntax.

NOTE: I have fixed bugs which are the most important for using in MagicPlot.
MagicPlot uses only some methods of java.awt.Graphics2D and 
only these methods were tested carefully. But I suppose this fixes may be usefull for someone.

FreeHEP VectorGraphics bug tracker seems to be dead by now (May 2012)...

=== Fixed: ===
- PDF, EPS: Font ebmedding: glyphs appeared mirrowed in documents. 
    Reason: incorrect y-coordinate.
- PDF, EPS: Font Embedding: Symbols out of standard encoding ignored
- PDF, EPS: Symbols out of standard encoding were drawn with standard 
    Symbol font instead of selected font. 
- PDF: Font embedding: only first font was embedded because of mistaken boolean flag usage.
- PDF: Raster images: AlphaComposite was ignored - no transluency
- PDF: Transparency was rendered in CMYK or RGB in different viewers: 
    Transparency group with color space was not set
- PDF: Page size must exactly correspond image size. New preferences keys added:
    in AbstractVectorGraphicsIO: ALLOW_RESIZING_AND_MARGINS, 
    ALLOW_BACKGROUND, ALLOW_PREVIEW_INCLUDING.
- EPS: Transparency with pdfmark SetTransparency feature
- EPS: Fonts writing is delayed: we need first to know what glyphs to embed

- SVG: Crop was not working
- SVG: Text tracking was not working.
- SVG: Font embedding checkbox was not present in options dialog.
- SVG: Image transparency (current AlphaComposite) was ignored
- SVG: Text underline

- Options dialog: Changed border design (simple TitledBorder).


=== Known issues and not realised yet: ===
- PDF: Type 1 fonts not open in STDU Viewer, in Mac Preview but works in Acrobat
- PDF, EPS: Text underline is not implemented
- PDF: TrueType fonts embedding is not implemented but some code exists in GraphicsIO package
